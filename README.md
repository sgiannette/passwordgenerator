# passwordgenerator

## Description

This project is a password generator for people to use in order to generate various random passwords. I built this project in order to create something that can provide a random password. Currently, people are not using secure enough passwords and are being "hacked". If they use this password generator, their passwords will be more secure and impossible to guess.
